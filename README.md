- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to work as a lifeguard at Boston Sports Club circa 2007 and the Cetltics Basketball Team showed up while I'm on duty. I saw Paul Pierce, Rajon Rondo.
- ⚡ Suddently a rookie player decided to jump on the kids pool and screamed lifeguard 2x!  I threw him a floater to grab and I went back right away to the mechanical room updating my logs and report.
- ⚡ The rookie wasn't happy and screamed again, why is this pool so deep? (10 ft deep) I replied, no need to worry since you have a floater (laugh and giggles from the celtics team),  You will live but if you need a hug, I pointed my finger to my female 
- ⚡ lifeguard companion and I said, that is your lifeguard.
